    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p> This page is all about images. If you are looking for <a href="links.html">links</a> or <a href="misc/extras.html">extra html</a> follow the links.</p>
    <h2>JPG's</h2>
    <p>Jpg file format is good for photos, something with large color pallate with no transparent pixel.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width='75' alt="A mochi ball in a bubble."/>
    <h2>GIF's</h2>
    <p>Gif is a good format for animated images, but lacks extensive color pallate and cannot have semi-opaque pixels.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width='75' alt="A dancing mochi ball."/>
    <h2>PNG's</h2>
    <p>Png is a good format for logos, diagrams, etc that need transparent pixels. They aren't good for photos, as they take large amount of space for complex images.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.png" width='75' alt="A mochi ball."/>
    <h2>SVG's</h2>
    <p>Svg is a format that is scaleable without losing definition, as it is a vector based image format. Infinitely scaleable.</p>

    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
    <p>This page is all about html LINKS! There are 3 kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute Links:
            <p>Ex. <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">Link</a>, a resource for web developers</p>
        </li>
        <li>Relative Links:
            <p>Ex. <a href='misc/extras.html'>Extras Page</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>Root Relative Links:
            <p> Ex... Well, there is no example. Since this isn't a hosted website, we can't use the Rooted link</p>
            <p> If it was a hosted website, the link href would start with a '/', meaning the very root folder of all the files.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
